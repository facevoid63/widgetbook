# Review (beta)

> **NOTE:** Since the Review feature is currently in beta, we're not aiming to migrate any data created previous to the official (non-beta) release to make changes to the feature easier for our development team.

The Widgetbook Cloud _Review_ feature (currently in beta) allows teams to review added, changed or removed components.
The Review feature closely relates to reviews known from Pull-Requests. 
For each Pull-Request, our new `widgetbook` CLI analyzes the changes to your Widgetbook and creates a review.
Members of a frontend-team now can review each _changed_ use-case in isolation and add comments for other team members.

Once all changes from the review are accepted, a developer closes the Pull-Request and the review's status gets updated to `merged`.
For this to work, a webhook to our services is required.

## Requirements

To use Widgetbook Cloud _Review_ your setup has to meet the following requirements:
- Use `widgetbook_generator` package in version `v2.4.1` (no special configuration required).
- Use `widgetbook` package in version `v2.4.1` (no special configuration required).
- Use the `widgetbook` CLI from the [widgetbook_cli](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_cli) package. For instructions see [Hosting](/widgetbook-cloud/hosting).
- Setup a GitHub webhook

## Setup Webhook (GitHub)

A GitHub Webhook allows Widgetbook Cloud to receive information about changes within your repository.
Widgetbook Cloud can automatically set the state of a Review to `closed` or `merged` when a corresponding Pull-Request is `closed` or `merged`.
For this to work, you need to configure a webhook. 
See [Setting up a webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/creating-webhooks#setting-up-a-webhook) for instructions on how to do this.
